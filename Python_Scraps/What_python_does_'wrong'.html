    <main><h1>What python does 'wrong'</h1>
<p>On the whole python done right will not trip you up very often with 'ah, but in this case' special bits. But there are the odd ones that need to be born in mind.</p>
<h2>Default Arguments are generated at run time</h2>
<p>This gets commented on enough that I am pretty sure that I'm far from the only one to get caught out by it. Default arguments are really handy. If your function has pretty much any sort of non-trivial internal variable, it is often worth the effort to make it an argument with a default value, allowing you to tweak it as you go. But there is a downside to this. Try out this classic:</p>
<pre><code>def list_default(d=[]):
    d.append(4)
    return d

k = list_default()
print(f"{k=}")
j = list_default()
print(f"{k=} {j=}")
</code></pre>
<p>This returns the following:</p>
<pre><code>k=[4]
k=[4, 4] j=[4, 4]
</code></pre>
<p>Huh? What? Why?</p>
<p>What happens is that the default empty list is created at runtime and shared every time that <code>list_default</code> is called. So not only does k and j refer to the same list, it changes the list every time its called. You probably wanted to have a fresh list every time though.</p>
<p>You can specify a default new empty list when you create dataclasses however, and its quite a handy thing to know how to do:</p>
<pre><code>from dataclasses import dataclass, field

@dataclass
class Fancy_list:

    my_list: list = field(default_factory=list)
</code></pre>
<p><code>field</code> has other neat tricks as well, like hiding attributes with <code>repr=False</code>.</p>
<p>This can be compounded by where an argument's scope lies - which is always outside the boundary of the function. So if you call <code>locals()</code> as a default argument, not only is it generated at runtime, it also generates the locals of the outer context where the function is first described, usually the global namespace. This can be summed up like this:</p>
<pre><code>def get_locals(locs=locals()):
    for l in locs:
        print(l)

def poor_parent():
    sad_child = "You will never inherit my throne! Never!"
    get_locals()
    # prints global context locals like __name__, __doc__, get_locals etc...

def good_parent():
    happy_child = "my daughter, this was my sword, now it is yours"
    get_locals(locals())
    # prints happy_child
</code></pre>
<p>Whilst there could be reasons why you could actually use these quirks to create useful stuff, it is probably better to go about such things in a more explicit way.</p></main>
